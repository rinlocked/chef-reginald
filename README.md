This is a HackBI IX Project made by Stephen Lebedz, Dean Lorenz, and Xavier Knox. 
Xavier - did all the pictures and design. 
Stephen helped him bring his ideas into the style.css file.
Dean - helped setup the Auth0 and setup the github repository. 
Stephen - wrote the HTML and linked the 3 files together.
Gemini (AI) - wrote majority of the JavaScript that enabled the Auth0, Gemini, and Speech Recognition to work. Also added a couple tiny aspects in the CSS.
